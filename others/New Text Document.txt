Students’ complaints have increased recently in tertiary education; hence the manual complaints system has become ineffective to handle the vast number of complaints, making it difficult for school authorities to respond adequately to each complaint made. Nevertheless, the advancement of internet and web technologies has paved the way to addressing this growing challenge electronically. This work sought to design a web-based student complaint system for Sunyani Technical University to help manage students’ complaints efficiency, security, accuracy, and reliability on campus. Based on the waterfall model design approach, we implemented the proposed complaints system with HTML, CSS formatting language and PHP for the frontend, MySQL database management for data keeping and PHP programming language for server-side scripting. The proposed approach was tested based on user-friendliness, robustness, security with both students and staff. The obtained feedback proves that our proposed system is adequate for handling students’ complaints accurately and fast than the conventional method.
